For my second assignment in the Intro to Web Programming with PHP course (Comp1006), under a time crunch, I evolved my original concept into a fully interactive Game Library Web Application. The application is structured around three core sections: a Home Page that welcomes users, a Form Page for the enthusiastic addition of beloved games, and a List Page that displays a dynamic table of all games added by the Users. This iteration introduces user authentication, the ability to edit and update game entries, and the capability to upload images, thereby enhancing user interaction and engagement.
